            <h2>About the Band</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Ghost is a Swedish rock band formed in 2006 in Linköping. The band consists of nine people: Pope Emeritus IV (frontman) and a group of musicians called the Nameless Ghouls.</p>
            <p>In 2010, Ghost released three demo tracks, then the single "Elizabeth", and in October the release of their debut studio album Opus Eponymous followed. British rock magazine Kerrang! included the song “Ritual” in the “Top 50 Most Evil Songs in History.”</p>
            <p>Opus Eponymous, nominated for the prestigious Swedish Grammis award (analogous to the American Grammy), contributed to the growth of the band’s popularity not only in their country, but throughout the world.</p>
            <p>Ghost are known for their eccentric stage performances. The band's musicians, the Nameless Ghouls (also known as the Nameless Ghouls), wear masks that conceal their identities.</p>
            <p>When Forge portrays Papa Emeritus, he wears a mask with makeup. The character is described as a "demonic anti-pope" and has gone through five reincarnations: Papa Emeritus I, II, III, Papa Emeritus Nihil (also known as Papa Emeritus Zero), and Papa Emeritus IV.</p>
            <p>For the 2018 album Prequelle and subsequent tour, Tobias Forge introduced a new character, Cardinal Copia. In March 2020, at the last show of the concert tour, Cardinal Copia received the title of Pope Emeritus IV and his distinctive skull makeup. In the album Impera (2022) and the subsequent tour, Tobias Forge remains in the role of Pope Emeritus IV.</p>
